# CodeBlocksTheme

Download the file color_theme.conf as a zip, extract it and transfer it to the theme folder under Code::Blocks installation folder.

Make sure Code::Block is closed. Run cb_share_config.exe. It should be under the folder where you install Code::Block. Load colour_themes.conf on your left and default.conf on your right. Select the themes that you want to import to Code::Block by clicking the check boxes on the left and then select Transfer>>> and Save. I will recommend select them all.

Open Code::Block. Go to Settings > Editor > Syntax highlighting. All the themes that you imported will be available under the color theme drop list.

After change the theme. You may notice that the insertion bar become hard to see if you use a dark background. But you can modify the color of the insertion bar under: Settings > Editorâ€¦ > Margins and caret. Change the color of the caret to some brighter colors.
